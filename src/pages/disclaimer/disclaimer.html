  <p text-left id="text-line">The ‘Bee Safe’ app has been developed by the Belfast Health and
    Social Care Trust (“the Trust”) with input from young people to create a platform for young
    people to become empowered with taking responsibility for their safety when they are able to
    do so.
  <br>
  <br>
    The ‘Bee Safe’ app provides the ability to create your own personalised
    safety plan, in a manner that is easily accessible. The ‘Bee Safe’ app offers the opportunity to create
    a personalised profile, a safety plan that can help you to understand and manage your feelings by  recording
    your feelings, triggers for these feelings and  distraction techniques to manage these feelings, and the 
    opportunity to collect information on them. The app has a photo function and a function which links you to 
    websites and You Tube and which allows you to create a scrapbook of memories. It also allows you to store 
    emergency and other contacts.
    <br>
    <br>
    Being able to keep yourself safe in different areas of your life is really 
    important. There will be layers to this; what you can do when you are feeling in different emotional 
    states, what you can do in an emergency, and what others can do for you. 
    <br>
    <br>
    It is recommended that you try and complete your safety plan when you are in a
    calm and relaxed state. It can include strategies that you have been working on with your Trust keyworker,
    or from other sources/paper resources. If you are already receiving treatment it is recommended that you discuss
    it with your Trust keyworker or other professional and with your parent/guardian, so they are aware of your safety
    plan and their role in supporting you with it. The app is not a replacement for your treatment, therapeutic work, 
    other safety plans you complete, or professional services, but rather an addition to them and is best used in 
    conjunction with them. Please remember if you are ever in a difficult place use your safety plan, use the resources
    available to you and speak to someone you trust. You are not in this by yourself.
    <br>
    <br>
    Information you include in the ‘Bee Safe’ app is saved to your own personal mobile device;
    it is not saved outside of this. You are therefore responsible for the information you save and share from it.

    Certain links in the ‘Bee Safe’ app will lead to websites that are not under the control of the Trust.
    When you activate these you will leave the ‘Bee Safe’ app. The Trust has no control over and accepts no liability in respect of materials,
    products, or services available on any website which is not under the control of the Trust. The Trust is providing these links to you only
    as a convenience and the inclusion of any link does not imply endorsement by the Trust of such website. The Trust shall not be liable for
